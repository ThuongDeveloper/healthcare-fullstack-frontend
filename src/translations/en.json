On the other hand, while it takes more effort to lead a healthy lifestyle, it is well worth it if you want to stay healthy. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, you need to be persistent in choosing healthy foods, incorporating more exercise and physical activity into your daily routine, and maintaining good hygiene. In addition, you need to avoid unhealthy habits such as fasting and not getting enough sleep. To improve your lifestyle, you need to make changes slowly and once you do, your health will be better.",
